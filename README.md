# Financial and Election Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts for data analysis:

1. **Financial Analysis Script (`financial_analysis.py`):**
   - Analyzes financial data from a CSV file to calculate metrics such as total months, net total, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.
   - Prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the 'Analysis' folder.

2. **Election Data Analysis Script (`election_analysis.py`):**
   - Analyzes election data from a CSV file to calculate metrics such as total votes, votes for each candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate, and identifies the winner.
   - Prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the 'Analysis' folder.

## Usage
