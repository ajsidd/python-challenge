# Financial and Election Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts for data analysis:

1. **Pybank Script (`main.py`):**
   - Analyzes financial data from a CSV file to calculate metrics such as total months, net total, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.
   - Prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the 'Analysis' folder.

2. **Pypoll Analysis Script (`main.py`):**
   - Analyzes election data from a CSV file to calculate metrics such as total votes, votes for each candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate, and identifies the winner.
   - Prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the 'Analysis' folder.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a CSV file with financial data named `budget_data.csv` in the 'Resources' folder.
2. Run the script `main.py`.
3. View the financial analysis results in the terminal.

### Election Data Analysis

1. Ensure you have a CSV file with election data named `election_data.csv` in the 'Resources' folder.

3. View the election analysis results in the terminal.
4. The results are also exported to a text file named `Election_analysis.txt` in the 'Analysis' folder.

## File Structure
